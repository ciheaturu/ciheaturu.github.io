**Remote Sensing and GIS for Ecologists** is a highly practical guide for ecologists and conservation scientists seeking to integrate spatial data into their research workflows. It is designed for beginners and intermediate users who want to understand both the **potential and limitations** of remote sensing in ecological contexts.

The book walks readers through **field data planning**, **spatial data acquisition**, **pre-processing**, and **advanced analytics**, culminating in ecological applications like **land cover classification**, **change detection**, and **species distribution modeling**.

What makes this book particularly valuable is its **exclusive reliance on OpenSource tools** â€” primarily **QGIS**, **R**, and **GRASS GIS** â€” and its use of **freely available datasets**, making it an accessible entry point for students and researchers working in resource-constrained environments.

The structure is both didactic and technical. Readers are exposed to:

- Clear introductions to spatial theory
- Hands-on exercises
- Code snippets for analysis and map-making
- Time-series approaches
- Land cover pattern and movement data analysis

Whether you're planning your first ecological mapping project or seeking to improve your geospatial rigor, this book is a **must-read foundational resource**. It balances clarity with technical depth and offers an excellent springboard for more advanced geospatial work in ecology.
