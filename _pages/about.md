I am a **Remote Sensing & Geospatial Data Scientist** and a Ph.D. researcher at the [Institute of Geography](https://www.geography.unibe.ch/), University of Bern. My research focuses on **tropical forest dynamics**, **ecosystem recovery**, and **landscape fragmentation** in West African agricultural frontiers, using multi-sensor Earth observation data.

My work integrates **UAV LiDAR**, **satellite time-series**, and **community-based knowledge** to explore the structural, compositional, and functional dimensions of forest change. I am passionate about developing **automated, reproducible spatial workflows** using Python and R, and translating these insights into policy-relevant environmental monitoring tools.

Currently, I contribute as a **Fellow in the IPBES Spatial Planning and Ecological Connectivity Assessment**, where I work on integrating geospatial data and land governance perspectives into global biodiversity science-policy processes.

Previously, I worked as GIS & Database Manager at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Nigeria, where I led spatial data infrastructure efforts across national conservation programs. I also collaborate actively with researchers across ecology, land systems science, and environmental justice.

When I’m not mapping forest patches or debugging Python scripts, you’ll probably find me following spatial data memes on [r/gis](https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/).
